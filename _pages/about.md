Hello! My name is Atharva Tikle, and I’m an engineer with a passion for creating innovative projects using microcontrollers and embedded systems. Currently pursuing my B.Tech, I have a solid foundation in Mechatronics Engineering, having completed a diploma in the field.  

Over the years, I’ve developed skills in Python, C++, Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, and robotics. My journey started with small projects, and it has now grown into designing PCBs, building robots, and exploring the exciting possibilities of open-source technology.  

I believe in combining creativity with technical knowledge to build solutions that are not only functional but also inspiring. From programming microcontrollers to designing intricate systems, I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and innovate.  

This blog is a space where I share my work, skills, and accomplishments. Whether it’s a new project, a lesson learned, or an idea worth exploring, I’m excited to document my journey and connect with others in the tech community.  

Feel free to explore my posts, check out my projects, or reach out to collaborate. Let’s create something amazing together!
