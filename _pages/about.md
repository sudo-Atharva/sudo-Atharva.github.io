# About Me

Hello, I’m Atharva Tikle, a passionate engineer currently pursuing my B.Tech, with a foundation in Mechatronics Engineering. Throughout my journey, I’ve been captivated by the endless possibilities of technology, particularly in the world of microcontrollers, robotics, and embedded systems.

## My Journey

I started my career in engineering with a diploma in Mechatronics, which gave me a solid foundation in mechanical, electrical, and computing principles. During my diploma, I began experimenting with Arduino and ESP32-based projects, which opened the door to a whole new world of opportunities.

Now, as a B.Tech student, I’ve honed my skills in Python, C++, and hardware design, focusing on microcontroller programming, PCB design, and 3D modeling. My passion for open-source projects fuels my drive to learn and build innovative solutions, and I am committed to continuously improving and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

## What I Do

I specialize in creating cutting-edge projects using microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, and ESP8266. Whether it's designing custom PCBs, building robotics systems, or programming embedded devices, I love combining creativity with technical skills to develop functional solutions. 

Here are a few things I do:
- **Microcontroller Programming**: Developing efficient code for a wide range of embedded systems.
- **PCB Design**: Designing and fabricating custom printed circuit boards.
- **Robotics**: Building and programming robots, with a focus on automation and AI.
- **3D Modeling**: Designing and printing 3D models for various projects.

## My Approach

My approach to every project is simple: **innovate, learn, and build**. I believe that the most exciting solutions come from blending creativity with practicality. Whether I’m working on a small Arduino project or a more complex robotics system, I aim to bring ideas to life through hands-on experimentation and open-source collaboration.

## Let’s Connect!

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve worked on. I’m always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and learning from others in the tech community. If you have any questions or want to discuss a project idea, don’t hesitate to reach out!

Let’s innovate together!
